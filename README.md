Upgrading from Roll Call Votes to Motions

These are my personal notes of motions offered to measures considered by the Council of the District of Columbia. They are my own records, not official Council records.

For an easy way to create motions, use the tool at http://exavolt.github.io/onde/

Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions for improvement.
Thanks!
