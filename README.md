Upgrading from Roll Call Votes to Motions

These are my personal notes of motions offered to measures considered by the Council of the District of Columbia. They are my own records, not official Council records.

For an easy way to create motions, use the tool at http://exavolt.github.io/onde/

A few usage notes: (1) I am not recording anything on the consent agenda; (2) I do not record temporaries unless they are separately considered; (3) the discussion order is not a perfect science; and (4) Amendments will be linked to motions in a separate file, not in the motions.

Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions for improvement.
Thanks!
