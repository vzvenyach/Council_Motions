Upgrading from Roll Call Votes to Motions

These are my personal notes of motions offered to measures considered by the Council of the District of Columbia. They are my own records, not official Council records.

For an easy way to create motions, use the tool at http://exavolt.github.io/onde/

For a neat example of how this can be used, check out dccode.org/motions/

A few usage notes: (1) I am not recording anything on the consent agenda; (2) I do not record temporaries unless they are separately considered; (3) the discussion order is not a perfect science; and (4) Amendments will be linked to motions in a separate file, not in the motions.

Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions for improvement.
Thanks!

#Update (2013-07-12)
I am also planning on loading the motions initially into CSV form and then converting them into JSON. There's a slightly different schema with the 2013-07-10 meeting and the meetings that proceed, but the data fields are the same. If anyone wants to do a pull request to clean up the old data, I'd appreciate it. In the meantime, I'm going to proceed with the new approach.

To convert the CSV to JSON, I'm using http://www.cparker15.com/code/utilities/csv-to-json/ and then doing a bit of additional "cleaning" from there.
